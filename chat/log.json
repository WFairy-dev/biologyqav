The world production of L-lysine has surpassed 2 million tons per year. Glucose uptake and phosphorylation by C. glutamicum mainly occur by the phosphotransferase system (PTS) and to lesser extent by inositol permeases and glucokinases. Heterologous expression of the genes for the high-affinity glucose permease from Streptomyces coelicolor and Bacillus subtilis glucokinase fully compensated [...] pyrroline 5-carboxylate reductase gene proC were overexpressed as synthetic operon. This enabled C. glutamicum to produce L-PA with a yield of 0.09 ± 0.01 g g(-1) and a volumetric productivity of 0.04 ± 0.01 g L(-1) h(-1).To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fermentative process for the production of L-PA from glucose.

However, deletion of the EYD1 gene (YALI0F01650g), believed to encode erythritol dehydrogenase, has been found [...] Conclusions:  The results of this study shed new light on the potential for the yeast Y. lipolytica to utilize macroalgae biomass as a carbon source for production of value-added products, including biomass and lipids. Moreover, the increased mannitol utilization capabilities can provide new insight into mannitol metabolism, including its uptake, which is especially crucial, as the metabolic pathways for all polyols produced by this organism seem to be closely intertwined.

However, one challenge that is still largely unreported in scaling-up cyanobacteria bioproduction is phenotypic instability, where the emergence and selection of nonproducing cells leading to loss in production has longer evolutionary timescales to take place in industrial-scale bioreactors. Quantifying phenotypic instability early on in strain development allows researchers to make informed decisions on whether to proceed [...] with scalable designs, or if present, devise countermeasures to reduce instability. One particularly effective strategy to mitigate instability is the use of genome-scale metabolic models to design growth-coupled production strains.

The sorghum brown midrib mutant 6 (bmr6) has a reduced lignin content in the cell walls and vascular tissues, which could potentially be advantageous for cellulosic biofuel production. Meanwhile, both dry matter yield and plant height were decreased in the bmr6 mutant. To identify genes affected in the mutant, differential gene expression analysis was performed for bmr6 and the wild type. As a result, a total of 1,052 [...] differentially expressed genes were detected between the two samples, of which 166 genes were downregulated and 886 genes were upregulated. Five hundred seventy-nine of the 1,052 differentially expressed genes could be assigned to 154 documented pathways. These pathways mainly included primary and secondary metabolism. Therefore, mutation of the bmr6 gene, which impaired the biosynthesis of lignin, ultimately affected the expression of these genes associated with the growth and development of [...] sorghum. Except for the bmr6 gene, 11 key enzyme genes of monolignols biosynthesis were upregulated. Promoter analysis identified that these genes have common MYB sites. It revealed that a feedback mechanism existed in the pathway and a MYB1 transcription factor (Sb02g031190) could associate with the upregulation of these genes in sorghum.

Some of these species can naturally produce, under specific growth conditions, lipids at high titers [...] Fatty alcohols have numerous commercial applications, including their use as lubricants, surfactants, solvents, emulsifiers, plasticizers, emollients, thickeners, and even fuels. Fatty alcohols are currently produced by catalytic hydrogenation of fatty acids from plant oils or animal fats. Microbial production of fatty alcohols may be a more direct and environmentally-friendly strategy since production is carried out by heterologous enzymes, called fatty acyl-CoA reductases, able to reduce"

Since acetone cannot be used as a biofuel, its production needs to be minimized or suppressed by cell or bioreactor engineering. Thus, there have been attempts to disrupt or inactivate the acetone formation pathway. Here we present another approach, namely, converting acetone to isopropanol by metabolic engineering. Since isopropanol can be used as a fuel additive, the mixture of isopropanol, butanol, and [...] ethanol (IBE) produced by engineered C. acetobutylicum can be directly used as a biofuel. IBE production is achieved by the expression of a primary/secondary alcohol dehydrogenase gene from Clostridium beijerinckii NRRL B-593 (i.e., adh(B-593)) in C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. To increase the total alcohol titer, a synthetic acetone operon (act operon; adc-ctfA-ctfB) was constructed and expressed to increase the flux toward isopropanol formation.

In this study, C. acetobutylicum was engineered for alcohol titers (butanol plus ethanol). The adc gene was inactivated to eliminate acetone production, and glutathione biosynthetic capability was introduced into C. acetobutylicum to improve the strain's robustness by expressing Escherichia coli's gshAB genes in the adc locus. Acetone [...] production was reduced from 2.64±0.22 g/L to 0.15±0.08 g/L in the engineered strain 824adc::gsh, whereas butanol production was increased from 5.17±0.26 g/L to 8.27±0.27 g/L. To further improve the alcohol titers, the metabolic flux in the alcohol biosynthesis pathways was enhanced. Overlapping PCR was used to generate expression cassette EC, which expresses the hbd, thl, crt, and bcd genes, and the Sol operon was amplified to express the adhE and ctfAB genes. Butanol and alcohol production [...] reached 14.86±0.26 g/L and 18.11±0.66 g/L, respectively, in 824adc::gsh Sol-EC. Furthermore, the butanol and alcohol yields were 0.336 g/g and 0.409 g/g, respectively, in 824adc::gsh Sol-EC.

However, currently no microorganism can produce biofuels, particularly butanol, directly from cellulosic biomass efficiently. Here we engineered a cellulolytic bacterium, Clostridium cellulovorans, for n-butanol and ethanol production directly from cellulose by introducing an aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE2), which converts butyryl-CoA to n-butanol and acetyl-CoA to ethanol.

Here, we introduced three different aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenases encoded by bdhB, adhE1, and adhE2 from Clostridium acetobutylicum into C. cellulovorans and studied their effects on ethanol and n-butanol production. Compared to AdhE2, AdhE1 was more specific for n-butanol biosynthesis over ethanol. Co-expressing adhE1 with bdhB produced a [...] comparable amount of butanol but significantly less ethanol, leading to a high butanol/ethanol ratio of 7.0 and 5.6 (g/g) in glucose and cellulose fermentation, respectively. Co-expressing adhE1 or adhE2 with bdhB did not increase butanol production because the activity of BdhB was limited by the NADPH availability in C. cellulovorans. Overall, the strain overexpressing adhE2 alone produced the most n-butanol (4.0 g/L, yield: 0.22 ± 0.01 g/g).

Recent studies aimed at engineering n-butanol production in C. cellulovorans represent milestones towards production of biofuels through one-step fermentation of lignocellulose but also indicated that more detailed understanding of the C. cellulovorans central carbon metabolism is essential to refine metabolic engineering strategies towards improved n-butanol production in this strain. The present study [...] Clostridium cellulovorans is among the most promising candidates for consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) of cellulosic biomass to liquid biofuels (ethanol, butanol). C. cellulovorans metabolizes all the main plant polysaccharides and mainly produces butyrate. Since most butyrate and butanol biosynthetic reactions from acetyl-CoA are common, introduction of single heterologous alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase can divert the branching-point intermediate (butyryl-CoA) towards butanol production in this [...] related to overexpression and secretion of (hemi-)cellulases), which induces up-regulation of ATP synthetic pathways, e.g. acetate production and ATP synthase. SIGNIFICANCE: C. cellulovorans can metabolize all the main plant polysaccharides (cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectins) and, unlike other well established cellulolytic microorganisms, can produce butyrate. C. cellulovorans is therefore among the most attractive candidates for direct fermentation of lignocellulose to high-value chemicals"

Nevertheless, products derived from microalgal TAG are not yet economically feasible; increasing TAG content via targeted genetic engineering of genes in TAG biosynthesis pathway are important to achieve economic viability. To increase TAG content, oleaginous microalga Neochloris oleoabundans was genetically engineered with the endogenous enzyme [...] Conclusions:  Our results demonstrate the considerably increased TAG content and productivity in N. oleoabundans by overexpression of plastidial NeoLPAAT1 that are important for products derived from microalgal TAG to achieve economic viability. Plastidial LPAAT1 can be a candidate for target genetic manipulation to increase TAG content in other microalgal species with desired characteristics for production of natural edible oils and biofuels.",

Enzymatic synthesis of these esters in aqueous phase is an environmentally friendly approach. In this study, an esterase RasEst3 from Rasamsonia emersonii was identified for fatty acid ester synthesis through sequence alignment. The gene encoding RasEst3 was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and its enzymatic properties were analyzed. The enzyme exhibited optimal activity at pH [...] 3.5 and 30 °C, with a preference for medium-chain substrates.

The growing market for amino acids produced with Corynebacteria led to significant improvements in bioprocess and downstream technology as well as in molecular biology. During the last decade big efforts were made to increase the productivity and to decrease the production costs. This review gives an overview of the world market for amino acids produced by Corynebacteria. Significant improvements in bioprocess technology, i.e. repeated fed batch or continuous production [...] are summarised. Bioprocess technology itself was improved furthermore by application of more sophisticated feeding and automatisation strategies.

Since macroalgae cultivation does not compete with land-based food crops for the necessary arable land or fresh water, it can increase the possibilities of sustainably harvested biomass. New technologies permit even land-based growing of marine macroalgae, besides the more common coastal or offshore cultivation.

Such a biomass industry should focus on the use of residual and waste biomass to avoid competition with the biomass requirements of the seaweed food industry, which has occurred in the case of terrestrial biomass.

In this article, update progress in butanol production is reviewed. Low price and sustainable feedstocks such as lignocellulosic residues and dedicated energy crops are needed for butanol production at large scale to save feedstock cost, but processes are more complicated, compared to [...] eliminating the formation of major byproducts acetone and ethanol so that butanol yield can be improved significantly. Although batch fermentation has been practiced for butanol production in industry, continuous operation is more productive for large scale production of butanol as a biofuel, but a single chemostat bioreactor cannot achieve this goal for the biphasic ABE fermentation, and tanks-in-series systems should be optimized for alternative feedstocks and new strains. Moreover, energy [...] those established for ABE fermentation from sugar- and starch-based feedstocks. While rational designs targeting individual genes, enzymes or pathways are effective for improving butanol yield, global and systems strategies are more reasonable for engineering strains with stress tolerance controlled by multigenes.

While microbial production of straight long-chain fatty alcohols has been achieved, biosynthesis of BLFLs has never been reported. In this work, we engineered four different biosynthetic pathways in Escherichia coli to produce BLFLs. We then employed a modular [...] 4. 1.

The aliphatic chains are also used as building blocks for structuring storage acylglycerols via the Kennedy pathway. Current research, aiming to enhance lipogenesis in the microalgal cell, is focusing on over-expressing key-enzymes involved in the earlier steps of the pathway of fatty acid synthesis. A complementary plan would be the repression of lipid [...] catabolism by down-regulating acylglycerol hydrolysis and/or β-oxidation. The tendency of oleaginous microalgae to synthesize, apart from lipids, significant amounts of other energy-rich compounds such as sugars, in processes competitive to lipogenesis, deserves attention since the lipid yield may be considerably increased by blocking competitive metabolic pathways.

The synthesis of the malonyl-CoA building block, catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1), is considered a limiting step to achieving high titers of polyketides and fatty acids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Acc1 is deactivated by AMP-activated serine/threonine protein kinase (Snf1) when glucose is depleted. To prevent this deactivation, the enzyme was aligned with the Rattus [...] norvegicus (rat) Acc1 to identify a critical amino acid (Ser-1157) for phosphorylation and deactivation. Introduction of a S1157A mutation into Acc1 resulted in 9-fold higher specific activity following glucose depletion. The enzyme was tested in yeast engineered to produce the polyketide 6-methylsalisylic acid (6-MSA). Both 6-MSA and native fatty acid levels increased by 3-fold. Utilization of this modified Acc1 enzyme will also be beneficial for other products built from malonyl-CoA.

[...] From a technical and economic point of view, our aim is to provide viable solutions for the replacement of fossil fuels which are currently used in internal combustion diesel engines. In this research, two new biofuels composed of second-generation vegetable oils (SVO),used oil sunflower (SO) or castor oil (CO), and the ABE blend (acetone/butanol/ethanol) were evaluated. ABE is an intermediate product from the fermentation of carbohydrates to obtain bio-butanol. Besides, the ABE blend exhibits [...] suitable properties as biofuel, such asvery low kinematic viscosity, reasonable energy density, low autoignition temperature, and broad flammability limits. Diesel/ABE/SVO triple blends were prepared, characterized and then, tested on a diesel engine, evaluating power output, consumption, and exhaust emissions. The power output was slightly reduced due to the low heating values of ABE blend. Also, engine consumed more fuel with the triple blends than with diesel under low engine loads whereas,",

Here, we introduced three different aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenases encoded by bdhB, adhE1, and adhE2 from Clostridium acetobutylicum into C. cellulovorans and studied their effects on ethanol and n-butanol production. Compared to AdhE2, AdhE1 was more specific for n-butanol biosynthesis over ethanol.

The work employed a membrane-based approach to deliver CH4 and O2 gases independently for methanotrophic growth, a process [...] referred to as Membrane Oxygenation and Methanotrophy (MOM). Performance metrics included bacterial yield, CH4 consumption rate, PHB content, and microbial community composition.

The MOM improved CH4 utilization efficiency up to 95.8% without gas circulation. Limiting CH4 availability during N-depletion promoted the PHB [...] content of the methanotrophic bacteria. However, excess CH4 in the headspace (>70% CH4 not being utilized) for the limited DO condition inhibited biomass growth and PHB production. Shallow metagenomic analysis showed that the bacterial species in the MOM reactors mainly belonged to the genera Methylocytis (up to 87% relative abundance) and Hyphomicrobium (up to 70% relative abundance).

The synthesis of the malonyl-CoA building block, catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1), is considered a limiting step to achieving high titers of polyketides and fatty acids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Acc1 is deactivated by AMP-activated serine/threonine protein kinase (Snf1) when glucose is depleted. To prevent this deactivation, the enzyme was aligned with the Rattus [...] norvegicus (rat) Acc1 to identify a critical amino acid (Ser-1157) for phosphorylation and deactivation. Introduction of a S1157A mutation into Acc1 resulted in 9-fold higher specific activity following glucose depletion. The enzyme was tested in yeast engineered to produce the polyketide 6-methylsalisylic acid (6-MSA). Both 6-MSA and native fatty acid levels increased by 3-fold.

Alternatively, synthetic consortia can be employed to compartmentalize the required metabolic functions among different specialized microorganisms as demonstrated in this work for the direct production of lactic acid from lignocellulosic biomass. We composed an artificial cross-kingdom consortium [...] consortium hexoses and pentoses were simultaneously consumed and metabolic cross-feeding enabled the in situ degradation of acetic acid. As a result, superior product purities were achieved and 19.8 gL-1 (85.2% of the theoretical maximum) of lactic acid could be produced from non-detoxified steam-pretreated beech wood. These results demonstrate the potential of consortium-based CBP technologies for the production of high value chemicals from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass in a single step.

The synthesis of the malonyl-CoA building block, catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1), is considered a limiting step to achieving high titers of polyketides and fatty acids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Acc1 is deactivated by AMP-activated serine/threonine protein kinase (Snf1) when glucose is depleted.

The additional overexpression of the endogenous xylulokinase enabled identical growth as the wild type strain in glucose. This mutant was able to produce up to 80g/L of citric acid from xylose. Transferring these modifications to a lipid-overproducing strain boosted the production of lipids from xylose.

While the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is a strong candidate for lipid production, it is currently unable to effectively utilize xylose. By introducing a heterologous oxidoreductase pathway and enabling starvation adaptation, we obtained a Y. lipolytica strain, E26 XUS, that can use xylose as a sole carbon source and produce over 15 g/L of lipid in bioreactor [...] Finally, this study also reveals the flexibility and dynamic nature of the Y. lipolytica genome, and the means at which starvation can be used to induce genomic duplications. [...] fermentations (29.3% of theoretical yield) with a maximal lipid productivity of 0.19 g/L/h. Genomic sequencing and genetic analysis pointed toward increases in genomic copy number of the pathway and resulting elevated expression levels as the causative mutations underlying this improved phenotype. More broadly, many regions of the genome were duplicated during starvation of Yarrowia. This strain can form the basis for further engineering to enhance xylose catabolic rates and conversion."

To estimate the plasma membrane turnover of oleic acid as compared to that of a saturated fatty acid, double-label experiments ([14C]oleic acid, [3H]palmitic acid) were performed. Following an inhibition delta 9-desaturase was found to be activated from the fourth hour of [...] stimulation. In the early period of cell activation this process proved to be independent of protein synthesis, whereas in the stage of proliferation it was dependent on it. Increased membrane fluidity in the first 30 min of activation is not likely due to enrichment of oleic acid. Cell proliferation and microsomal desaturation seem to be coupled and an increasing amount of oleic acid is at least one of the factors resulting in increased fluidity of the surface membrane of proliferating cells.

As an oleaginous yeast that is generally regarded as safe, Yarrowia lipolytica has been extensively studied, with large amounts of data on its lipid metabolism, genetic tools, and genome sequencing and annotation."
